## Description

_This site asks the user for their age in years, and their life expectancy in years (default 100), then displays what their age and life expectancy would be on other planets. If their age is greater than their life expectancy, then the duration that they have outlived their life expectancy is displayed._

* _Download all files into the same directory and run "npm install" in the terminal from the project directory_
* _Then run "npm run build" in the terminal from the project directory_

* _Alternatively, run "npm run start" instead of "npm run build" and a browser window will open_
